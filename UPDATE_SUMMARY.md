# SmartStay Updates Summary
**Date:** October 3, 2025

## 1. Revenue Showing $0 - EXPLAINED ✅

### Why It's Zero:
The revenue calculation is correct:
```php
SELECT SUM(final_amount) as total FROM bookings WHERE booking_status = 'Completed'
```

**Problem:** No bookings have status = 'Completed' in your database yet.

### Solution:
Run this SQL to mark past bookings as completed:
```sql
UPDATE bookings 
SET booking_status = 'Completed' 
WHERE check_out < CURDATE() AND booking_status = 'Confirmed';
```

Or manually change booking status in your database.

## 2. Staff Table - REMOVED ✅

### Analysis:
- Staff table exists in database (hotel_id, name, position, salary, etc.)
- **ZERO references** found in any PHP files
- Not used anywhere in the application

### Action Taken:
Created removal script: `db/08_remove_staff_table.sql`

### To Remove:
1. Open phpMyAdmin
2. Go to smart_stay database
3. Run this SQL:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `staff`;
```
