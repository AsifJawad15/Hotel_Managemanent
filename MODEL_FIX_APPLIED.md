## 🔄 How to Change Models

### Method 1: Edit .env File (Recommended)
```bash
# Open .env file
notepad d:\xampp\htdocs\SmartStay\.env

# Change this line:
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini

# To one of these:
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo     # Fastest/Cheapest
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini       # Balanced (current)
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o            # Most accurate

# Save and restart Apache
```

### Method 2: Test Different Models
Try each model with the same query to compare:

```
Query: "Show top 10 hotels by revenue last month"

gpt-3.5-turbo result: [test it]
gpt-4o-mini result: [test it]
gpt-4o result: [test it]
```
