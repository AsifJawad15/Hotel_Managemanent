# Hotel Payment Confirmation Feature

## Overview
Hotels can now view all bookings and confirm payment status directly from their dashboard. When a guest books a room, the hotel receives the booking with "Pending" payment status and can update it to "Paid" once payment is confirmed.

## How It Works

### For Guests
1. **Book a room** through the guest portal
2. **Payment status** is initially set to "Pending"
3. **Booking status** is "Confirmed" (awaiting payment confirmation)
4. Guest waits for hotel to confirm payment

### For Hotels
1. **View all bookings** at `hotel_bookings.php`
2. **See pending payments** highlighted in yellow
3. **Verify payment** (via cash, card, online transfer, etc.)
4. **Update payment status** from dropdown:
   - **Pending** → Initial state
   - **Partial** → Partial payment received
   - **Paid** → Full payment confirmed ✅
   - **Refunded** → Payment refunded

5. **Booking automatically confirmed** when payment marked as "Paid"

## Features
