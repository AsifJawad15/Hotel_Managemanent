## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### If AI Generation Fails

1. **Check API Key**
   ```bash
   # Open .env and verify key is correct
   notepad .env
   ```

2. **Test Connection**
   ```
   http://localhost/SmartStay/test_openai_connection.php
   ```

3. **Enable cURL**
   ```
   # Edit php.ini
   C:\xampp\php\php.ini
   
   # Find and uncomment:
   extension=curl
   
   # Restart Apache
   ```

4. **Check Internet**
   ```bash
   ping api.openai.com
   ```

### If Database Tables Missing

```bash
# Import the schema
mysql -u root -p smart_stay < db\09_ai_assistant.sql
```

### If "Access Denied"

```
Make sure you're logged in as admin:
http://localhost/SmartStay/pages/admin/admin_login.php
```
