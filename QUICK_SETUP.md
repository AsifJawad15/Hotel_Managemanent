## üîç Verify Everything Works

Run these SQL queries in phpMyAdmin to verify:

### Check Guest 1's Bookings:
```sql
SELECT 
    b.booking_id,
    b.check_in,
    b.check_out,
    b.booking_status,
    b.payment_status,
    b.final_amount,
    h.hotel_name,
    CASE 
        WHEN b.check_out < CURDATE() THEN 'Past'
        WHEN b.check_in <= CURDATE() AND b.check_out >= CURDATE() THEN 'Current'
        ELSE 'Future'
    END as period
FROM bookings b
JOIN rooms r ON b.room_id = r.room_id
JOIN hotels h ON r.hotel_id = h.hotel_id
WHERE b.guest_id = 1
ORDER BY b.check_in DESC;
```

### Check Total Revenue:
```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_bookings,
    SUM(CASE WHEN booking_status = 'Completed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed_bookings,
    SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'Paid' THEN final_amount ELSE 0 END) as total_revenue,
    SUM(CASE WHEN payment_status = 'Pending' THEN final_amount ELSE 0 END) as pending_revenue
FROM bookings;
```

### Check Triggers and Events:
```sql
-- Check if trigger exists
SHOW TRIGGERS LIKE 'bookings';

-- Check if event exists
SHOW EVENTS;

-- Enable event scheduler (if not already enabled)
SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: SQL file gives errors
**Solution:** Make sure you selected the `smart_stay` database before running the SQL

### Issue: Trigger already exists error
**Solution:** The SQL file includes `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` - just ignore the warning

### Issue: Event scheduler not running
**Solution:** Run `SET GLOBAL event_scheduler = ON;` in phpMyAdmin SQL tab

### Issue: Still showing Pending status
**Solution:** 
1. Clear browser cache (Ctrl + Shift + Delete)
2. Refresh the page (F5)
3. Or close browser and reopen

### Issue: No Write Review buttons
**Solution:** Make sure the booking's checkout date is in the past or status is Completed

### Issue: Revenue still shows $0
**Solution:** Run the UPDATE queries from the SQL file to fix existing data
